      Everybody who participates at DjangoCon Africa in one way or another is
      required to conform to this Code of Conduct (CoC). This includes
      attendees, speakers, sponsors, organisers and volunteers. <br /><br />
      We will introduce a Code of Conduct team that will be primarily
      responsible for handling any incidents at the conference. The CoC applies
      before and throughout the event (including related activities such as
      social events, and social media).

      <ul>
        <li>
          {% blocktranslate %}
          Helping everyone feel safe and included. Many attendees are first
          timers, or have had poor experiences in other events. We want to set
          the expectation that harassment and other unpleasant behavior are not
          acceptable. So that if people do have an unpleasant experience, they
          know that’s not neither the norm nor acceptable to us as a community.
          {% endblocktranslate %}
        </li>
        <li>
          {% blocktranslate %}
          Helping to build trust that if an incident is reported, we will not
          respond with victim blaming, and that we will do a thorough
          investigation. Even, for example, if the incident concerns someone in
          a position of power.
          {% endblocktranslate %}
        </li>
        <li>
          {% blocktranslate %}
          Informing everyone of the expected behavior. We are a diverse
          community, and having a Code of Conduct makes the expectations of
          everybody’s behavior explicit and transparent.
          {% endblocktranslate %}
        </li>
        <li>
          {% blocktranslate %}
          Having a framework for report handling. The Code of Conduct is the
          basis for dealing with a report, assessing whether the CoC was
          violated, and what action should be taken.

        <li>
          {% blocktranslate %}
          We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
          This includes offensive comments related to the categories above,
          deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
          recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, violent
          threats or language, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
          sexual attention.

          Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist,

      <p>
        {% blocktranslate %}
        This Code of Conduct applies to all conference related spaces. That
        includes, but is not limited to:
        {% endblocktranslate %}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>{% translate "The conference venue(s)" %}</li>

          Slack channels, tweets with the conference hashtag, and other online
          media

      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        {% blocktranslate %}
        The Code of Conduct does not exclusively apply to events on the
        conference agenda. For example, if after a scheduled social event you go
        to a bar with a group of fellow participants, and someone harasses you
        there, we would still treat that as a CoC violation.

        In case of a Code of Conduct violation, some of the most common actions

          other participants.

        <li>{% translate "Not publishing the video of a conference talk." %}</li>

      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        {% blocktranslate %}
        The action taken is at the discretion of the Code of Conduct team.
        Participants are expected to comply immediately, and further action may
        be taken in case a participant does not comply. A record will be kept of
        all incidents.

      <p>
        {% blocktranslate %}
        Please do not feel like you may be a burden to us by reporting
        incidents. Even if you happen to report multiple incidents during the
        conference. We rather consider reports an opportunity for us to act: by
        knowing about an incident, we can act on it, and often prevent it from
        continuing or repeating. But if we don’t know, we can’t take action.
        {% endblocktranslate %}
        <br /><br />
        {% blocktranslate %}
        If you are not sure whether the situation was a Code of Conduct
        violation, or whether it applied to that particular space, we encourage
        you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports
        where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an
        actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the
        incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not
        violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve
        the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

        If you feel unsafe reporting in person, you may choose someone to
        represent you. In this case, we’d need their contact information, but
