        <ul>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                Make sure the title of your proposal is attention grabbing. Conferences typically need to review a lot of talk 
                proposals, so you want to make sure yours looks interesting.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                Try reading your proposal aloud - it should sound like normal human speech. If it leaves you breathless then 
                you probably need some punctuation.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% translate "Your proposal should not look like a wall of text." %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                Make use of the “notes” section of the talk submission form. You can use this to leave messages for the talk reviewers. 
                Eg: you might want to say something like: “I have submitted a few proposals, but this is the one I am 
                most interested in talking about”, “I’m not sure about the title, here are some alternative titles that might work.” 
                or “Please connect me with a speaker mentor”.
            {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                If you have multiple ideas then feel free to make multiple proposals. You can let the conference organizers pick 
                which one seems most appropriate.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                Don’t try to be extra fancy and add in big words that are unnecessary. The point of an abstract is to communicate 
                an idea, so you should focus on clear communication. Take a look at this.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>

            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                Light background with dark text is easiest to read; be mindful that the projection screen is white. 
                Choose fonts with adequate spacing between letters, and avoid thin or cursive fonts.
            {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                If your talk requires live coding or using the terminal, make sure your editor or terminal settings are legible. 
                Dark text on a light background (high contrast) with a large font is best.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% translate "Images, memes, and GIFs should be appropriate for a professional audience." %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                Avoid or limit flashing videos or animated GIFs, as these may have negative effects for people with seizure 
                disorders, migraines, or ADD/ADHD.

                Please be in your presentation room at least 15 minutes before your talk in order to set up and meet your

                We may ask you to draft your slides as much as 3 weeks ahead of the conference. We won’t share the slides with 
                anyone outside of the conference organizing team.

                Our community is warm and welcoming, the fact that you are putting effort into contributing is something everyone 
                will appreciate.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                It is normal to stumble from time to time, if you trip over your words then be willing to laugh at yourself and the audience 
                will like you more. Or if you can’t laugh at yourself, just pause for a moment, take a breath or a sip of water and keep going. 
                The audience can wait for a few seconds while you gather your thoughts, it’s ok.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                If you are prone to anxiety then make a point of practicing your talk in front of an audience ahead of 
                time - your friends, family and colleagues can be very useful here.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>

        <h2>{% translate "Practicing your talk" %}</h2>
        <p>{% blocktranslate %}
            Some people write out a script and then memorize that. Some people are expert freestylers. 
            Both approaches work well, but both need serious preparation.
            {% endblocktranslate %}

            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                If you need cue cards or speaker notes then keep them brief - if you just stare down at your notes 
                that would be bad. Practice looking up and away from your notes.
                {% endblocktranslate %}</li>

            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                This method might sound easier, but you probably need to know about 30% more about your topic if you 
                want to freestyle effectively.

            <li>{% blocktranslate %}
                If you don’t know the answer to a question then be willing to say “I don’t know”. It’s really ok to not 
                have perfect knowledge. Don’t pretend to know things you don’t and don’t try to distract people from the main 
                question, just be honest about what you know.
