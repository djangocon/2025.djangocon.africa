    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>DjangoCon Africa has dedicated everything to ensure a fun and educative harassment-free conference experience for
        everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
        religion.
        However everyone is required to conform to this Code of Conduct (CoC). This includes attendees, speakers,
        sponsors,
        organisers and volunteers.
    </p>

    <h2>Why we have a Code Of Conduct</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            To ensure everyone feels safe and included. Many attendees are first timers, or have had poor experiences in
            other
            events. We want to set the expectation that harassment and other unpleasant behavior are not acceptable. So
            that
            if
            people do have an unpleasant experience, they know that’s not neither the norm nor acceptable to us as a
            community.</li>
        <li>

            To build trust that if an incident is reported, we will not respond with victim blaming, and that we will do
            a
            thorough
            investigation. Even if the incident concerns someone in a position of power.
        </li>
        <li>
            To inform everyone of expected behavior. We are a diverse community, and having a Code of Conduct makes the
            expectations
            of everybody’s behavior explicit and transparent.

        </li>
        <li>

            To inform everyone on report handling. The Code of Conduct is the basis for dealing with a report, assessing
            whether the
            CoC was violated, and what action should be taken
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>
        Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for DjangoCon Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
        Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of
        the
        conference organizers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ensure you abide by the constitution of Tanzania and all regulatory bodies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all
    </p>

    <h2>What can Happen if Our Code of Conduct is Violated</h2>

    <p>This Code of Conduct applies to all conference related spaces. That includes, but is not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The conference venue(s)</li>
        <li>The conference hotel(s)</li>
        <li>Any conference related social activities</li>
        <li>Slack channels, tweets with the conference hashtag, and other online media</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Code of Conduct does not exclusively apply to events on the conference agenda. For example, if after a
        scheduled
        social event you go to a bar with a group of fellow participants, and someone harasses you there, we would still
        treat
        that as a CoC violation.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Inappropriate Behavior</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Harassment of any participants in any form </li>
        <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
        <li>Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes</li>
        <li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit
            permission
        </li>
        <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
        <li>Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit
            suicide or
            to
            engage in self-harm</li>
        <li>Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban</li>
        <li>Sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks</li>
        <li>Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up
            for
            ridicule</li>
        <li>Excessive swearing</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
        <li>Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or
            “backrub”)
            without consent or after a request to stop</li>
        <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
            others
            Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events
        </li>
        <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
        <li>Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different
            backgrounds
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This list is not an exhaustive list of all inappropriate behavior that is unacceptable at DjangoCon Africa
    </p>

    <h2>When to Report Incidents</h2>

    <p>

        If you believe someone has violated the Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it.
    </p>

    <p>

        If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by the
        Code
        of
        Conduct, we encourage you to still report it.
    </p>

    <p>

        We are fine with receiving reports where we decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer space.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedures for Reporting Incidents</h2>

    <p>Please report code of conduct violations to the code of conduct team. If you are unable to do so, please reach
        out to
        any of the DjangoCon Africa Organisers</p>

    <p>When you report an incident via email, please include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)</li>
        <li>Date and time of the incident</li>
        <li>Location of incident</li>
        <li>Whether the incident is ongoing</li>
        <li>Description of the incident</li>
        <li>Identifying information of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent,
            identifying
            badge information such as company name, ribbons, or badge number</li>
        <li>Additional circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
        <li>Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please provide as much information as possible.
        You will receive feedback promptly or within 24 hours after submitting the report.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>

    <p>All reports will be kept confidential. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize
        details
        as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.
    </p>

    <p>However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized the reported
        person
        may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please
        note
        those in your report.
    </p>
    <p>
        We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. In
        some
        cases,
        we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.
