                If you are making anything that is useful to Django developers, such as developer tools, SaaS products or 
                hosting platforms, this is the perfect marketing opportunity. Africa is a fresh and ready market; and a booth at 
                our conference will enable to meet new potential customers for your products.

                DjangoCon Africa will uphold the tradition of existing DjangoCons all over the world of investing in great efforts 
                in being a diverse conference. Africa itself is very diverse with a total of 54 countries made up of many different 
                ethnicities. Only with the help of our sponsors can we be able to bring people from all social backgrounds and different 
                parts of the world together at our very first event.
                {% endblocktranslate %}

                There is no better place to recruit Django developers than a DjangoCon! DjangoCon Africa is the largest single
                gathering of Django developers in Africa. Sponsoring the very first DjangoCon Africa will put you directly in front 
                of a fresh candidate pool.
                {% endblocktranslate %}
            </li>
            <li>
                {% blocktranslate %}
                If you use Django or related projects to build your software products, sponsoring DjangoCon Africa is a good way 
                to give back to the community and say “thank you” to its members. Any open source community survives on the goodwill 
                of its members and the conference is an important gathering to meet and discuss the future of Django. At the same time, 
                sponsoring allows us to keep ticket prices affordable and even offer financial aid for developers from marginalized 
                groups who could not otherwise join.
                {% endblocktranslate %}

                Your own employees can profit a lot from attending DjangoCon Africa. Not only does the conference provide valuable 
                education in form of talks and workshops that improve their professional talks and technical skills, it is also the 
                best single place to start and build a network within a community of potential future partners.

        Djangocon Africa is run by volunteers on a non-profit basis. All the money we receive will go towards covering 
        the costs of the event and reducing the cost for our attendees. This includes:
